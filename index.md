### Business Systems, Integration and Development ###

  I specialize in working with customers to not only identify their business process needs, but integrate the systems needed for their success. Most clients need a solution out of the box, but sometimes those solutions need assembled with API integrations, DNS settings, or a little code to push information around. Other times, companies require refactoring internal code, writing lightweight web applications for specific needs, or just a small script to process customer data for analysis. I break down my process into three skill areas:
  
### Business Systems ###
  Despite being the broadest level of analysis, deciding on a business system relies a lot on detail. Specifically, I focus on F.L.O.W for design consideration:
  
  - First: What information does the client need processed? 
  - Last: How will this information be used? What objective does it satisfy?
  - Order: What's the critical path from the unstructured information (First) to the structured information (Last)?
  - Who: Most importantly, who will be using this system?

  The goal is to know from start to finish what information that's coming in, how it needs to be processed, and what the interface should be to process that information. From this we crate a rubrik and do a search for the right software that fits the clients flow. 

### Integration ###
  Integration has two parts: Data Communication & Human Interface. Data communication often using internal features of the product for connections, but sometimes API code is needed. Human Interface is more important though. Training, tutorials and feedback are needed to get the client comfortable and proficient with their business systems.
  
### Development ###
  Lastly, sometimes a client needs hands on software development. Either some scripting for data analysis or a web application for special applications.
