  As a business systems and development professional I do more than just write code. I investigate a clients business needs, discover software solutions, and integrate them into a customer's business. I break down my focus into three skill areas:
  
### Business Systems ###
  Despite being the broadest level of analysis, deciding on a business system depends on the details. Specifically, I focus on F.L.O.W for design consideration:
  
  - First: What information does the client need processed? What is the details and format?
  - Last: How will this information be used? What objective does it satisfy?
  - Order: What's the critical path from the unstructured information (First) to the structured information (Last)?
  - Who: Most importantly, who will be using this system and how?

  The goal is to know from start to finish what information there is, how it needs to be processed, and what the interface should be to process that information. It's also important to consider the typical business user's habits and preferences. From this we create a rubrik and do a search for the right software that fits the clients flow. 

### Integration ###
  Integration has two parts: Data Communication & Human Interface. Data communication often using internal features of the product for connections, but sometimes API code is needed. Human Interface is more important of the two though. Training, tutorials and feedback are needed to get the client comfortable and proficient with their business systems.
  
### Development ###
  Lastly, sometimes a client needs hands on software development. Either some scripting for data analysis, refactoring aging code, or a web application for special applications.
